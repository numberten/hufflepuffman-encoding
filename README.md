Hufflepuffman Encoding
======================


Pretty much huffman encoding. Not the best huffman encoding, but not terrible huffman encoding. Not the bravest, smartest, or most cunning of huffman encodings, but pretty darn loyal huffman encoding. Not exactly academy award winning huffman encoding of legend, but a strong supporting character encoding nonetheless.

Where they are Just $ and loyal,  
Those patient\* Hufflepuffs are True,  
And \[unafraid, of, toil\]"_
