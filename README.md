Hufflepuffman Encoding
======================

Not the bravest, smartest, or most cunning of huffman encodings, but loyal through thick and thin.

How to run
----------
    - Compile
    - Run with command line args
        - arg0: "encode" or "decode"
        - arg1: path to file to be encoded or decoded
        - arg2: path to newly generated binary or decoded file
    - Profit

Old version (see Old/huffman.hs)
--------------------------------
    - Kept for side-by-side speed comparisons.
    - If compiled with ghc, -O2 flag recommended.
    - Runs ~22 times slower than refactored version (with -O2).
